Sysconfig::Hardware

(./config)
./hwcfg-*
- list all names (weed out ~, .rpm*)
- list some names (shell glob?, regex?)

for a given name (->file)
keys and values are strings (maybe we want stricter typing?)
- key = value  (a special case of the next, possibly simpler to type)
- key = value, key = value... (optionally implemented in one run)
  take care of escaping
- get value for key
- get values for keys
- get values for all keys
- file permissions - preserve, correctly create
deleting and reading nonexistent keys/files: use nil or equivalent
 (alternative: have special call for delete)
maybe access comments
maybe access metadata (typing)
-> need to have templates


so these are the generic string-only classes
class SysconfigFile
class SysconfigFiles

if we want types, there will be special classes using SysconfigFile as
backend

class ResolvConf
string process
list<string> nameserver
list<string> search
string domain
boolean write_header

class XAuth
string key
(the interface is weird)

class Hosts
# improve. currently:
list<string> ips ()
string names (string ip)
names (string ip, string names)
# also bug 35671

RootCurlrc
string proxyuser "user:passwd"

class Routes
list<Route>
class Route
string destination
string gateway
stringnetmask
[
string device
[string extrapara]
]
